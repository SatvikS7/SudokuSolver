# SudokuSolver
Java-based program that utilizes backtracking in order to efficiently solve any possible sudoku. As of 10/2/23, inputs for new sudoku boards must be made within the program; however, flexibility to this is in development. If no board solution is found, a statement of "No solution exists" will be printed. 

Currently Developing frontend of the game in coordination with personal website.
